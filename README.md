# 🏥 Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

A comprehensive statistical and exploratory data analysis of the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset for cancer diagnosis prediction.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project provides a complete analysis of breast cancer diagnostic data, using statistical methods and exploratory data analysis to identify key characteristics that distinguish malignant from benign tumors.

## 📋 Dataset Information

- **Source**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
- **Samples**: 569 patients  
- **Features**: 30 numeric features + 1 target variable
- **Task**: Binary classification (Malignant vs Benign)
- **Target Distribution**: 357 Benign (62.7%), 212 Malignant (37.3%)

## 🔬 Analysis Highlights

### Key Findings
- **No missing values** - excellent data quality
- **Strong predictive features** identified through correlation analysis
- **Statistically significant differences** between malignant and benign groups
- **Feature clustering** reveals natural groupings of measurements

### Top Discriminative Features
1. **concave points_worst** (correlation: 0.794)
2. **perimeter_worst** (correlation: 0.783)
3. **concave points_mean** (correlation: 0.777)
4. **radius_worst** (correlation: 0.776)
5. **perimeter_mean** (correlation: 0.743)

### Statistical Results
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Highly significant differences in tumor size (p < 0.001)
- **Effect Size**: Large clinical effect (Cohen's d = 0.875)
- **Clinical Significance**: Malignant tumors are 5.32 units larger in radius on average
